Of course, this does not mean that two out of every three people on Earth have a mobile phone. It is common in more than 60 coun- tries, however, for one person to have two or more devices, even while there are no phones at all in some parts of the globe. In some countries, millions of people are now experiencing connectivity to the world for the first time through wireless technologies.  It is changing their economic, social, and political fortunes forevermore.\\n   The number of wireless users on 3G services continues to rise daily. Informa estimates that there are nearly 415 million 3G subscriptions to date, with 77% share of the 3G market on UMTS/HSPA1 networks or 320 million connections, and the remaining 95 million subscribed to the older CDMA EV-DO2 technology. The number of commercial UMTS/HSPA networks has risen to 258 in more than 100 countries, including 41 net- works in 20 countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region. It is a foregone conclusion that HSPA and HSPA+3 will compete with all prevail- ing mobile wireless technologies available today. Telstras recent commercial launch of HSPA+,reports peak theoretical downlink speeds of 21.6 Mbps.

What if you could get everything you need accomplished using simple widgets that leverage your mobile device-based browser to access the cloud? The potential impact on enterprise mobility is huge. While organizations are deploying more and more Software-as-a-Ser- vice (SaaS) applications, there is no reason mobile workers cant access those applications from their mobile devices, assuming they have enough band- width (i.e., 3G- or 4G-capable devices). All that is really required beyond such bandwidth is a browser that can actually handle all of the various SaaS- associated web standards. Imagine a future environment in which mobile device manufacturers will partner with multiple SaaS vendors to provide enterprises complete cloud-based computing solutions that wor k anywhere.\\n\\n9.2    What Is a Smartphone?\\n\\nThe definition of a smartphone is not standardized and varies depending on who you ask. For most users, the consensus is that a smartphone is a mobile device that offers advanced capabilities beyond those offered by a typical mobile phone. Modern versions come with PC-like functionality. Many of the newer models have customized operating systems and associated soft- ware that provides a standardized interface. Nearly all smartphones have advanced features such as email, Internet access,  instant messaging, etc. Smartphones are much more than just another cell phone. They provide instant access to the web, which translates into immediate collaboration capability. Whether you are researching financial news to predict the stock market or looking for the perfect golf course to treat your client, its on the Internet. Most smartphones allow you to sync data with your desktop com- puter. You can store and work on documents from your smartphone, and you can receive and reply to emails as they arrive in your inbox using real- time push email.\\n   Smartphone applications may be developed by the manufacturer of the device or by any other third-party provider or developer capable of accessing the open source operating system. Other functionalities might include an additional interface such as a miniature QWERTY keyboard on the touch screen, built-in video and camera features, contact management, built-in navigation software, office document processing capability, and software for playing music and viewing video clips. Such smartphone capabilities trans- form the common cell phone into a mobile multimedia platform for y our\\n\\n\\nentertainment. They can store and display pictures, videos of friends and family, or even play live broadcasts of sports or movies.\\n\\n9.3    Mobile Operating Systems for Smartphones\\n\\nMany regard the smartphone  as a minicomputer with a phone. Most smart- phones use an identifiable and open source operating system, often with the ability to add user applications. This is a major factor differentiating smart- phones from traditional mobile phones, which only support dedicated, pro- prietary applications. In the next few sections, we will take a look at several popular mobile devices and the operating systems used with them.\\n\\n9.3.1    iPhone\\n\\nThe Apple iPhone uses 3G technology, and its operating system (OS) is based on the Darwin OS. Darwin forms the core set of components on which both the Mac OS X and iPhone OS are based. Darwin is compatible with Single UNIX Specification  version 3 (SUSv3) and POSIX UNIX applications and utilities. The iPhone touts features such as Global Position- ing System (GPS) mapping, support for enterprise applications such as Microsoft Exchange, the new App Store, etc. The iPhone is a wide-screen mobile device very much like the iPod. It provides users a rich interface with HTML email and an outstanding web browser. The iPhone home screen is shown in Figure 9.1.\\n   The iPhone lets you customize your home screen with applications and web clips of your choosing. You can arrange the icons any way you want or even create as many as nine home screens, each customizable to your needs. For example, if you check the same web site every day, you can create a web clip to access it directly from your home screen using a single tap of a finger. You can always press the home button  to go back to your main home screen. iPhone supports rich HTML email which allows you to see email attachments in their original format. The iPhone supports more than a dozen file and image formats, including PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, Pow- erPoint, and iWork attachments. Support for Microsoft Exchange Active- Sync gives you push email that arrives automatically to your inbox, as shown in Figure 9.2.\\n\\n9.3.2    Google (Android)\\n\\nAndroid is a software platform and operating system for mobile devices that is based on the Linux kernel. It was originally developed by Google and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.1    The iPhone home screen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.2    The message inbox for iPhone.\\n\\nlater with the Open Handset Alliance (which is a group of more than 30 technology and mobile companies). The Android operating system is the first complete, open, and free mobile platform. An Android Software Devel- opment Kit is available to help developers get started on new applications. Android allows developers to write managed Java code to control a mobile device. Developers can distribute their applications to users of Android mobile phones. There is a marketplace called Android Market that enables developers to easily publish and distribute their applications directly to users of Android-compatible phones. The T-Mobile G1, shown in Figure 9.3, is one of the better-known commercial offerings using Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.3    The T-Mobile G1.\\n\\n   Google has now released most of the Android code under the Apache license, a free software and open source license. Figure 9.4 shows the major components of the Android operating system.\\n   Android developers have full access to the same framework application programming interfaces (APIs) used by the core applications. The architec- ture is designed to simplify reuse of components, so any application can publish its capabilities and any other application may then make use of those capabilities (subject to security constraints enforced by the frame- work). This same mechanism allows framework components to be replaced by the user. Underlying all applications is a set of services  and systems, including:\\n\\n\\n1.\\tA rich, extensible set of views that can be used to build an appli- cation (i.e., lists, grids, text boxes, buttons, and an embedded web browser)\\n\\n2.\\tContent  providers that allow applications to access  data from other applications or to share their own data\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.4    Major components of the Android operating  system. (Source: http://\\nd.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html.)\\n\\n3.\\tA resource manager to manage access to noncode resources such as localized strings, graphics, and layout files\\n\\n4.\\tA notification manager that enables all applications to display custom alerts in the status bar\\n\\n5.\\tAn activity manager to manages applications and provide a com- mon navigation stack\\n\\n\\n    Every Android application runs in  its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine (VM). The Dalvik virtual machine is a major piece of Googles Android platform for mobile devices. It runs Java platform applications which have been converted into a compact Dal- vik Executable (.dex) format suitable for systems that are constrained in terms of memory and processor speed.3 Dalvik has been written so that a device can run multiple VMs efficiently. The Dalvik VM relies on the Linux kernel version 2.6 for underlying functionalities such as threading, low-level memory management, and core system services such as security,\\n\\n\\n3.        Dalvik Virtual Machine, Wikipedia,  retrieved 8 Mar 2009.\\n\\n\\nmemory management, process management, network stack, etc. The ker- nel acts as an abstraction layer between the hardware and the rest of the software stack.\\n\\n9.3.3    Blackberry\\n\\nThe BlackBerry solution consists of smartphones integrated with software that enables access to email and other communication ser vices. Developed by the Canadian company Research In Motion (RIM), the BlackBerry is a wireless handheld device originally introduced in 1999 as a two-way pager. In 2002, RIM released their version of the smartphone, named BlackBerry. It supported push email, mobile telephony, text messaging, internet faxing, web browsing, and other wireless  information services.  BlackBerry  first made progress in the commercial marketplace by concentrating on enter- prise email. The BlackBerry has a built-in QWERTY keyboard, optimized for thumbing (the use of only the thumbs to type). System navigation is primarily accomplished by a scroll ball in the middle of the device (older devices used a track wheel on the side). Their current solution gives mobile users access to email, phone, data, applications, games, and the Internet from a state-of-the-art smartphone, as shown in Figure 9.5.\\n   The BlackBerry  offers an end-to-end encryption solution with two transport encryption options, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) for all data transmitted between their BlackBerry Enterprise  Server and licensed BlackBerry smart- phones. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authen- ticated environment and are assigned to each BlackBerry smartphone user. Each secret key is stored only in the users secure enterprise  email account and on the users BlackBerry  smartphone. Data sent to the BlackBerry is encrypted by  the  BlackBerry Enterprise Server using the  private key retrieved from the users mailbox. Next, the encrypted information is trans- ported securely across the network to the smartphone, where it is decrypted using the key stored on the smartphone. Data remains encrypted in transit and is never decrypted outside of the corporate firewall.\\n\\n9.3.4    Windows Mobile\\n\\nWindows Mobile is a compact operating system offering a set of basic appli- cations commonly found on mobile devices. It is based on the Microsoft Win32 API. Devices that run Windows Mobile include pocket PCs, smart- phones, portable media centers, and on-board computers for certain auto- mobiles. Windows Mobile is designed to appear similar to desktop versions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.5    The Blackberry.\\n\\nof Microsoft Windows. The platform supports third-party software devel- opment. Originally, Windows Mobile appeared as the pocket PC 2000 operating system, then known as Windows Compact Edition (CE). Since then, Windows Mobile has been updated several times. The next planned release, Windows Mobile 7.0, is slated for the latter part of 2009. Figure 9.6 shows what it is expected to look like.\\n    Microsoft had projected in 2008 that it would see an increase of devices shipping with Windows Mobile from 11 million to 20 million units. It missed its initial goal, selling only 18 million licenses, but even that number indicates the phenomenal growth of this market. Microsoft attributed the shortfall in its prediction to the delayed launch of some smartphone devices. Since then, Windows Mobiles  market share as an operating system for smartphones worldwide has fallen from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2008.4\\nWindows Mobile now has a worldwide smartphone market share of 14%. It is interesting to note that Microsoft  licenses its Windows Mobile platform\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.6    Windows  Mobile\\n\\nto four of the worlds  five largest mobile phone manufacturersa strong testament to its popularity in the marketplace.\\n\\n9.3.5    Ubuntu Mobile Internet Device (MID)\\n\\nUbuntu MID Edition is designed specifically for mobile internet devices (MIDs). Ubuntu MID is based on the popular Linux distribution Ubuntu. Ubuntu MID is highly flexible and customizable. It is an open source plat- form that is best suited to the kind of product differentiation that reaches target users in the mobile marketplace. MIDs generally have the following common features and attributes:\\n\\n\\n1.     Small size/form factor, typically a 4- to 7-inch touch screen\\n\\n2.     Physical and/or virtual keyboard\\n\\n3.     Wi-Fi, 3G, Bluetooth, GPS, WiMAX\\n\\n4.     2- to 8-GB Flash or disk storage\\n\\n\\n4.

Web applications such as Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, and Dailymotion are easily supported. Ubuntu MID needs no stylusyou navigate using a touchscreen. Just tap the screen or drag a finger for navigation and control. To launch applications, tap the application icon with your finger or tap menus and buttons to use them. You can swipe a web page to pan up, down, or sideways, and you can swipe a video, photo, song, or thumbnail page to move to the next or the previous one. Figure 9.9 shows the home screen of Ubuntu MID.\\n    In the next few pages we highlight some of the applications found in the default distribution of Ubuntu MID, to give you a feel for what capabilities exist on modern mobile devices and how they can enhance daily life, simply by facilitating collaboration via the Internet. When you first get the device running, it is important to set preferences such as time and date (see Figure\\n\\n\\n5. \\tClutter is an open source software library for creating  fast, visually rich, and animated graphical  user interfaces.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.8    Flash user interface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.9    Ubuntu  MID home screen.\\n\\n9.10) and to perform any system updates to bring the version current with any releases or updates since your particular version was made available.\\n   To update your system, simply tap the System menu and select the Update  Manager.

You can even update the system\\n\\n\\nitself using this tool. After checking with the ser ver to see what may have changed, you will be presented with the screen shown in Figure 9.12.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.12    Installing updates.\\n\\n   Simply click the green checkmark button to install updates. For the example in Figure 9.12, five updates will be installed. The first part of the installation downloads the updates, as shown in Figure 9.13.\\n   The download will proceed and, depending on your connection speed, may take anywhere from a few seconds to minutes to complete. After the downloads complete, installation proceeds automatically. You may be asked to reboot the device to complete the install process.\\n   Mobile users deal with office documents on a daily basis. Ubuntu MID offers an office document reader to read various document types such as .doc, .pdf, .xml, etc. The reader is shown in Figure 9.14 displaying a .pdf file.\\n   For users who need more than a read-only display of a document, Ubuntu MID also offers a complete mobile office solution, OpenOffice  ver- sion 2.4 (see Figure 9.15), which allows you to build presentations, spread- sheets, documents, etc. It is a very popular solution in the open source community.\\n    Figure 9.16 shows the editing of an .html document using OpenOffice.

FBReader is an ebook reader included with Ubuntu MID. FBReader works on Linux, Windows XP/Vista, FreeBSD, and various other Linux-based mobile operating systems. FBReader is dis- tributed under the terms of the GNU GPL. It supports many ebook for- mats,  such  as  fb2  ebook  format,  HTML,  CHM,  plucker, Palmdoc, zTxt,TCR, RTF, OpenReader, and plain text format. Direct reading from tar, zip, gzip, and bzip2 archives is also supported. FBReader can perform automatic library building, and automatic language and character encoding detection is also supported.

See Figure 9.20.\\n\\n9.4    Mobile Platform Virtualization\\n\\nSmart phones with rich and open operating systems are growing in popular- ity, resulting in a market that is undergoing tremendous innovation and change. The pressure to reduce development costs and get phones to market faster has increased competitive pressure to deliver feature-rich phones to market faster and to migrate from proprietary operating systems to open operating systems without compromising the security of trusted services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.19    Ubuntu  MID instant messenger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9.20    Internet browsing on Ubuntu  MID.\\n\\n   As mobile phones have become more powerful, beyond their basic phone functionality, phones now offer music, video, cameras, and built-in GPS capabilities. Rich applications are being built every day by a vibrant developer community utilizing the open operating systems. As these capa- bilities have been developed, the mobile phone users  ability to include applications, pictures, videos, music, emails, bank and credit card informa- tion, and personal information management (PIM) have all been combined to provide a much richer and more valuable experience into a persona that is\\n\\n\\nportable and can be transferred seamlessly when upgrading to a new phone. The ability to protect and migrate personas will become an important pur- chasing decision. The risk of not securing and managing employee-owned devices if they contain confidential information is significant, and managing a wide variety of devices is complex in terms of both cost and security. Vir- tualization is a key enabling technology to address these issues.\\n    Security is a serious issue for mobile handsets running an open source operating systems. There are already a significant number of known viruses, and their numbers are growing fast for mobile phones but  still lag far behind the number of known PC viruses. The mobile handset user is a rov- ing agent in a wireless IT world, and security is every bit as important as it is in the fixed-wire IT world. The frequent emergency security upgrades and patches common in the PC world, however, would be unacceptable to the average user of a mobile handset. Such an approach to security could stall the proliferation of smart and feature phones. Consequently, security must be designed in from day one of the handsets life cycle. Real-time virtualiza- tion solutions offer robust security via hardware-enforced memory isolation of partitions, isolating each operating system from the others and prevent- ing cross-corruption. In addition, specific partitions may be added and used to execute secure applications in small certifiable environments protected from the larger open environment or real-time operating system (RTOS) executing in other partitions. Security cannot be an afterthought.\\n   A virtualization solution may be used to ease introduction of smart phone software functionality to an existing feature phone hardware plat- form, with minimal effort and cost. Virtualization-based solutions open up the phone software architecture to bring added functionality to both feature phones and smartphones in terms of service availability, security, and device management. Two examples of virtualization software being used on smart- phones are discussed in the following.\\n\\n9.4.1    KVM\\n\\nKernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is open source software that is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT  or AMD-V). KVM consists of a kernel module, kvm.ko, which provides the core virtualization infrastructure, and a proces- sor-specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko, depending on the CPU manufacturer (Intel or AMD). KVM also requires a modified QEMU,7 although work is underway to get the required changes upstream. Multiple\\n\\n\\nvirtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images can can be run using KVM. . A wide variety of guest operating systems work with KVM, including many versions of Linux, BSD, Solaris, Windows, Haiku, ReactOS, and the AROS Research Operating System. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc. The kernel component of KVM is included in Linux, as of the 2.6.20 ker- nel version.\\n    KVMs performance  is good, but not as good as that of some of the more mature products, such as VMware or VirtualBox. For example, net- work and graphics speeds are noticeably slower with KVM. In general, KVM performance can offer near-native speed, thanks to its use of Intel VT or AMD-V extensions.  As an open source product, it is being very actively developed and is constantly improving.\\n\\n9.4.2    VMWare\\n\\nVMware Mobile Virtualization Platform (MVP) is a thin layer of software that is embedded on a mobile phone to separate the applications and data from the underlying hardware. It is optimized to run efficiently on low- power, low-memory mobile phones. MVP is planned to enable handset vendors to bring phones to market faster and make them easier to manage.8\\nVMware inherited the MVP software when it bought Trango Virtual Pro- cessors in October 2008. The technology serves much the same function as VMwares  flagship server product, adding a flexible software layer onto hardware and making it easier to move applications from device to device.9\\nMVP currently supports a wide range of real-time and rich operating sys- tems, including Windows CE 5.0 and 6.0, Linux 2.6.x, Symbian 9.x, eCos,\\nITRON NORTi, and C/OS-II.\\n    VMware MVP benefits end users by being able to run multiple profiles (e.g., one for personal use and one for work use) on the same phone. Increasingly, handset vendors and carriers are migrating from proprietary operating systems to rich open operating systems so that their customers can choose from the widest selection of applications. With this transition to open operating systems, however, protection of trusted services such as digi-\\n\\n\\n7. \\tAccording to Wikipedia,  QEMU is a processor  emulator  that relies on dynamic  binary translation  to achieve  a reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPU archi- tectures,  QEMU, Wikipedia,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU, retrieved 9 Mar 2009.\\n8.        http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/mvp.html.\\n9. \\thttp://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/vmware-lends-virtual-hand-to-mobile-phone- crowd.\\n\\n\\ntal rights management, authentication, billing, etc., is becoming of incr eas- ing concern. VMware MVP allows vendors to  isolate these important trusted services from the open operating system and run them in isolated and tamper-proof virtual machines so that even if the open environment is compromised, the trusted services are not affected.\\n   With VMware solutions, desktop and IT security administrators get the control and visibility they need to protect mobile data and prevent mali- cious code intrusion, while end users get the freedom and flexibility of any- time, anywhere access to their own familiar desktop environment. For virtual  teams  and  telecommuters with  a  steady Internet  connection, VMware View (formerly VMware Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, VDI) can be used to deliver remote access to server-based virtual desktop PCs through a secure network connection. Using VMware View, an organization can keep desktop images and sensitive information stored on servers behind the corporate firewall, eliminating the risk of a security breach as a result of lap- top theft, allow remote access through a Web browser for maximum flexibil- ity, or keep access limited to  PCs with VMware View client software installed for maximum control, and can prevent data leakage and network intrusions with strong encryption, multifactor authentication, and access control policies for client-side USB devices.10\\n    Mobile users with intermittent access to the Internet can use VMware ACE to deploy assured computing environments (ACEs) that workers can use on corporate-owned laptops, employee-owned PCs, or even iPods and USB memory sticks without putting sensitive corporate information at risk. VMware ACE clients are encapsulated inside a single file or package, and ACE packages can be secured with strong encryption to protect the entire virtual desktop environment, not just specific files and folders. Administra- tors can set and enforce granular policies governing the lifespan of each ACE client package, the networks it can access, and the peripheral devices that can interface with it, with Active Directory integration for unified user authentication. The result is a scalable solution that helps enhances the mobility of users while protecting access to valuable corporate information assets.11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10.      http://www.vmware.com/solutions/desktop/mobile.html.\\n11.      http://www.vmware.com/solutions/desktop/mobile.html.\\n\\n\\n9.5    Collaboration Applications for Mobile Platforms\\n\\nThe growing popularity and power of mobile devices and the demand for business solutions and collaboration tools on mobile devices, along with Web 2.0 as a new platform for developing interactive applications across devices, has ushered in a new era for collaboration technologiesas can be seen in the advent of devices such as the Apple iPhone, the BlackBerry Storm touchphone, and the Google phone. The adoption of mobile collab- oration services is not just a matter of design but also depends on factors such as mobile network coverage and pricing structures, all of which have been leveraged by these three phones, and others are on the way.\\n   Mobile phones have evolved rapidly in the past few years, from special- ized devices for voice communication to  a general-purpose computing devices that are able to run a rich variety of data applications. The latest mobile phones also provide a variety of networking options such as cellular, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and WiMAX, which serve a range of coverage and band- width requirements. Mobile phones have now become the device of choice for people to keep in touch with family members, friends, and business partners. Current mobile phones allow people not only to make telephone calls but also to access email and short messages, play games, share informa- tion,  run  video conferences, and  coordinate business actions. Mobile phones are now equipped with faster processors, larger memory, and longer- life batteries. Many mobile phones today come with integrated position- tracking and camera features. Many of the software tools previously avail- able in personal digital assistants (PDAs), tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs have been ported to mobile phones, such as office and multimedia applica- tions. Today, many collaboration technologies are widely used, such as email, instant messaging, data conferencing, workflow, wiki, and social net- working systems.\\n   Collaboration technologies based on  mobile phones have unique advantages over laptops and desktop systems because they are lightweight and can fit into pockets or purses. They are truly mobile and can be con- nected all the time, which means you can take your desktop with you: Col- laboration software on mobile hand-held devices provides the ability to be productive wherever you are. In this new era of mobile computing, the next generation of collaboration technologies on mobile phones is being developed to enable consumers to collaborate anytime, anywhere, using just their mobile phones. Although mobile collaboration technologies ar e still in their infancy and there is still significant room for progress, there\\n\\n\\nhave been several significant recent developments, such as the  Cisco WebEx collaboration software, which currently has over 60% of the web collaboration conferencing software market,12  being ported over to the iPhone13; the IBM Lotus Notes Traveler being extended to support a range of S60-based Nokia mobile phones built on the S60 third edition of the Symbian operating system and providing a major alternative to Windows Mobile device support14; and Unison Technologies recently announcing its free unified communications software offering in a direct challenge to industry giants Microsoft and Google.15\\n\\n9.6    Future Trends\\n\\nThe real value of cloud computing is that it makes software and data avail- able transparently and everywhereinclude the mobile environment. Con- sumers of  cloud  computing  services purchase computing  capacity on demand and need not be concerned with the underlying technologies used to achieve server capabilities. Computing resources are being accessed which are typically owned and operated by a third-party provider on a consoli- dated basis in data center locations. This stateless model facilitates much greater scalability than conventional computing and can be used in con- junction with virtualization to achieve maximum data center and comput- ing resource utilization. One of the key elements of a stateless computing environment is a networked storage system that enables ubiquitous avail- ability of software, making the cloud the ideal environment to  enable mobile smartphone users to access its powerful computing power remotely.\\n    Each day, more and more users connect to the Internet using their mobile devices. The mobile operating system as an extension to the cloud is emerging as a value-added alternative to sophisticated and complex operat- ing systems such as Windows. New players such as Apple and Google are developing their mobile operating systems to challenge Symbian and Win- dows Mobile.

In the future, cloud computing will also reduce the need for unnecessary full appli- cation overhead by using the mobile smartphone as a dumb terminal to leverage the powerful computing power of the cloud.\\n\\n9.7    Chapter Summary\\n\\nCloud computing for mobile devices is taking off with the expansion of high-speed wireless networks around the world. Mobile devices take data out of homes and offices and put them in our pockets, increasing the attrac- tiveness of cloud computing as a model to connect end users with mor e than just the Internet and email while they roam. This means that much of your vital data will be available not just at home, at the office, or in your wallet, but can easily be accessed by hooking up to the huge memory of the Internet cloud with a mobile device. Consumers are beginning to demand not  only access to  hotel and  restaurant directions, airline reservations, weather reports, social networking sites, personal email and instant messag- ing, but also full and secure access to their business applications at work or a business partners site as well.\\n   The cloud is becoming increasingly pervasive and mobile browsers are getting better every day, providing the ability to access the cloud and its applications Organizations are deploying more and more SaaS-based appli- cations and, assuming they have enough bandwidth, there is no reason that mobile workers cannot access those applications on their devices with a browser that can actually fully handle web and cloud standards. In this chapter we described the mobile smartphones platforms, their operating systems, virtualization of these platforms, mobile collaboration applications, and future trends.\\n\\n9.8    Closing Comments\\n\\nCloud computing is in a period of strong growth, but cloud technology is still somewhat immature and will take another few years to mature. Devel- opment will probably be dominated by a select group of vendors, mostly technologically aggressive  application development organizations. There will likely be proliferation of new vendors and then subsequent consolida- tion as cloud computing becomes appealing to more mainstream develop-\\n\\n\\nment organizations.  As with any other technology going through a period of rapid growth, the stronger small players will survive and the weaker players will be driven out of the market. In the meantime, demand for interopera- bility and integration will likely drive a widely supported fabric of intrac- loud application programming interfaces that will be developed to link cloud-based  systems across vendor platforms. This consolidation and inte- gration, along with improved security, privacy, and governance enhance- ments, will broaden the appeal of cloud computing while building the tr ust of consumers, who will increasingly offload large portions of their IT infra- structure to third parties such as the SaaS providers described throughout this book. The cloud is going to be the hot topic in the next fe w years and probably beyond, and it is not just IT personnel who will need to under- stand the benefits of cloud computing, but personnel across the entire busi- ness continuum. Many consumers and companies are missing out on the benefits of cloud computing because they do not fully grasp the concept of cloud computing; we hope this book has improved your grasp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'Chapter 9 - Mobile Internet Devices and the Cloud.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '72e9c986f4190f9096a7f6839b8c8d64'}>, <Document: {'content': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUNIT 1  OVERVIEW OF CLOUD COMPUTING\\n\\nMeaning of the Terms cloud and cloud computing\\n\\nThe Evolution of Cloud Computing Cloud Based service Offerings Benefits of cloud model Limitations,Legal issues\\nKey Characteristics of cloud computing\\n\\nChallenges for the cloud\\n\\nIntroduction to service oriented Architecture and virtualization\\n\\n\\nMeaning of the Terms cloud and cloud computing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cloud\" is just a metaphor for the internet.\\n\\n\\nIn the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of your computer\\'s hard drive.\\n\\nSimply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing servicesincluding servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligenceover the Internet (the cloud) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Evolution of Cloud Computing\\n\\nCloud computing is all about renting computing services. This idea first came in the 1950s. In making cloud computing what it is today, five technologies played a vital role. These are distributed systems and its peripherals, virtualization, web 2.0, service orientation, and utility computing.\\n\\n\\n\\nDistributed Systems\\nIt is a composition of multiple independent systems but all of them are depicted as a single entity\\n\\nto  the  users.  The  purpose  of  distributed  systems  is  to  share  resources  and  also  use  them effectively and efficiently. Distributed systems possess characteristics such as scalability, concurrency, continuous availability, heterogeneity, and independence in failures. But the main problem with this system was that all the systems were required to be present at the same geographical location. Thus to solve this problem, distributed computing led to three more types of computing and they were-Mainframe computing, cluster computing, and grid computing.\\n\\n\\nMainframe computing\\nMainframes which first came into existence in 1951 are highly powerful and reliable computing\\n\\nmachines. These are responsible for handling large data such as massive input-output operations. Even today these are used for bulk processing tasks such as online transactions etc. These systems have almost no downtime with high fault tolerance. After distributed computing, these increased the processing capabilities of the system. But these were very expensive. To reduce this cost, cluster computing came as an alternative to mainframe technology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCluster computing\\nIn 1980s, cluster computing came as an alternative to mainframe computing. Each machine in\\n\\nthe cluster was connected to each other by a network with high bandwidth. These were way cheaper than those mainframe systems. These were equally capable of high computations. Also, new nodes could easily be added to the cluster if it was required. Thus, the problem of the cost was solved to some extent but the problem related to geographical restrictions still pertained. To solve this, the concept of grid computing was introduced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrid computing\\nIn 1990s, the concept of grid computing was introduced. It means that different systems were\\n\\nplaced at entirely different geographical locations and these all were connected via the internet. These systems belonged to different organizations and thus the grid consisted of heterogeneous nodes. Although it solved some problems but new problems emerged as the distance between the nodes increased. The main problem which was encountered was the low availability of high bandwidth connectivity and with it other network associated issues. Thus. cloud computing is often referred to as Successor of grid computing.\\n\\n\\nVirtualization\\nIt was introduced nearly 40 years back. It refers to the process of creating a virtual layer over the\\n\\nhardware which allows the user to run multiple instances simultaneously on the hardware. It is a key technology used in cloud computing. It is the base on which major cloud computing services such as Amazon EC2, VMware vCloud, etc work on. Hardware virtualization is still one of the most common types of virtualization.\\n\\nWeb 2.0\\nIt is the interface through which the cloud computing services interact with the clients. It is\\n\\nbecause of Web 2.0 that we have interactive and dynamic web pages. It also increases flexibility among web pages. Popular examples of web 2.0 include Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Needless to say, social media is possible because of this technology only. In gained major popularity in 2004.\\n\\nService orientation\\nIt acts as a reference model for cloud computing. It supports low-cost, flexible, and evolvable\\n\\napplications. Two important concepts were introduced in this computing model. These were Quality of Service (QoS) which also includes the SLA (Service Level Agreement) and Software as a Service (SaaS).\\n\\nUtility computing\\nIt  is  a  computing  model  that  defines  service  provisioning  techniques  for  services  such  as\\n\\ncompute services along with other major services such as storage, infrastructure, etc which are provisioned on a pay-per-use basis.\\n\\n\\nCloud Based Service Offerings\\n\\n\\nCloud computing can be viewed as a service available for data centers. But cloud computing and centers are not the same.\\n\\nThe main difference between the cloud vs. data center is that a data center refers to on-premise hardware   while   the cloud refers   to   off-premise computing.   The cloud stores   your data   in the public cloud, while a data center stores your data on your own hardware.\\n\\nThe Service Offerings include\\n\\n\\nSaaS: Software thats available via a third-party over the internet\\n\\n\\nSoftware as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internetas a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.\\n\\nSaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS providers servers. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.\\n\\nPaaS: Hardware and software tools available over the internet.\\n\\n\\nPlatform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a cloud  service  provider on  a  pay-as-you-go  basis  and  access  them  over  a  secure  Internet connection.\\n\\nIaaS: Cloud-based  services,  pay-as-you-go  for  services  such  as  storage,  networking,  and virtualization.\\n\\nIn the IaaS model, the cloud provider manages IT infrastructures such as storage, server and networking resources, and delivers them to subscriber organizations via virtual machines accessible  through  the  internet.  IaaS can  have  many  benefits for  organizations,  such  as potentially making workloads faster, easier, more flexible and more cost efficient.\\n\\n\\nSaaS examples: BigCommerce, Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, MailChimp, ZenDesk, DocuSign, Slack, Hubspot.\\n\\nPaaS examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Windows Azure (mostly used as PaaS), Force.com, OpenShift, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud.\\n\\nIaaS examples: AWS EC2, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Digital Ocean\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:-Explore about Google App Engine and identify it is which type of Cloud service and also about (MSPS)Managed Service Providers\\n\\nBENEFITS OF USING CLOUD MODEL\\n\\n\\n1. Efficiency / cost reduction\\n\\n\\nBy using cloud infrastructure, you don\\'t have to spend huge amounts of money on purchasing and maintaing equipment. This drastically reduces capex costs. You dont have to invest in hardware, facilities, utilities, or building out a large data center to grow your business. You do not even need large IT teams to handle your cloud data center operations, as you can enjoy the expertise of your cloud providers staff.Cloud also reduces costs related to downtime. Since downtime is rare in cloud systems, this means you don\\'t have to spend time and money on fixing potential issues related to downtime.\\n\\n2. Data security\\n\\n\\nOne of the major concerns of every business, regardless of size and industry, is the security of its data. Data breaches and other cybercrimes can devastate a company\\'s revenue, customer loyalty and brand positioning.Cloud offers many advanced security features that guarantee that data is securely stored and handled.Cloud storage providers implement baseline protections for their platforms and the data they process, such authentication, access control, and encryption. From there, most enterprises supplement these protections with added security measures of their own to bolster cloud data protection and tighten access to sensitive information in the cloud.\\n\\n\\n3. Scalability\\n\\n\\nDifferent companies have different IT needs -- a large enterprise of 1000+ employees won\\'t have the  same  IT  requirements  as  a  start-up.Using  cloud  is  a  great  solution  because  it  enables enterprise to efficiently -- and quickly -- scale up/down their IT departments, according to business demands.Cloud based solutions are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your business demands increase, you can easily increase your cloud capacity without having to invest in physical infrastructure. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors.This scalability minimizes the risks associated with in-house operational issues and maintenance. You have high- performance resources at your disposal with professional solutions and zero up-front investment. Scalability is probably the greatest advantage of the cloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Mobility\\n\\n\\nCloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients  and  coworkers.Resources  in  the cloud  can  be easily stored,  retrieved,  recovered,  or processed with just a couple of clicks. Users can get access to their works on-the-go, 24/7, via any devices of their choice, in any corner of the world as long as you stay connected to the internet. On top of that, all the upgrades and updates are done automatically, off-sight by the service providers. This saves time and team effort in maintaining the systems, tremendously reducing the IT team workloads.\\n\\n\\n5. Disaster recovery\\n\\n\\nData loss is a major concern for all organizations, along with data security. Storing your data in the cloud guarantees that data is always available, even if your equipment like laptops or PCs, is damaged. Cloud-based services provide quick data recovery for all kinds of emergency scenarios\\n-- from natural disasters to power outages.Cloud infrastructure can also help you with loss prevention. If you rely on traditional on-premises approach, all your data will be stored locally, on office computers. Despite your best efforts, computers can malfunction from various reasons -\\n- from malware and viruses, to age-related hardware deterioration, to simple user error.But, if you upload  your data to the cloud, it remains accesible for any computer with an internet connection, even if something happens to your work computer.\\n\\n6. Control\\n\\n\\nHaving control over sensitive data is vital to any company. You never know what can happen if a document gets into the wrong hands, even if its just the hands of an untrained employee.Cloud enables you complete visibility and control over your data. You can easily decide which users have what level of access to what data. This gives you control, but it also streamlines work since staff will easily know what documents are assigned to them. It will also increase and ease collaboration. Since one version of the document can be worked on by different people, and there\\'s no need to have copies of the same document in circulation.\\n\\nLIMITATIONS OF CLOUD\\n\\n\\n1. Risk of data confidentiality\\nThere is always a risk that user data can be accessed by other people. So data and cloud\\n\\nprotection must be good because if it wont be dangerous for data confidentiality.\\n\\n\\n2. Depends on internet connection\\nThe internet is the only way to cloud computing. When there is no internet connection in your\\n\\nplace, or the internet path to the cloud provider is in trouble, automatically access to your cloud computing machine will be disconnected. Now this is where the biggest obstacle is happening in developing countries and remote areas that do not have good internet access.And the weakness of public cloud is where everyone accesses the same server and server and will increase the risk of attack, and down the server.\\n\\n\\n3. The level of security\\nSecrecy and security are among the most doubtful things in cloud computing. By using a cloud\\n\\ncomputing system means we are fully entrusted with the security and confidentiality of data to companies that provide cloud computing servers. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue the server for errors in the data.\\n\\n4. Technical problem\\nBesides that the use of Cloud Computing makes you unable to manage it yourself when there is a\\n\\nproblem or a problem, you must contact customer support who is not necessarily ready 24/7. This is a problem because for some support you also have to pay more money.\\n\\n5.Low Connection\\nDoes not work well if the connection is slow. The quality of cloud computing servers is one of\\n\\nthe most important considerations before we decide to provide cloud computing server service providers. When the server is down or the permorma is not good, we will be harmed because of poor server quality.\\n\\nLegal Issues\\n\\n\\nRecently there have been some efforts to create and unify the legal environment specific to cloud for example the united states European union safe harbor provides a seven point framework these are\\n\\n1.   Notify individuals for the pupose for which information is collected and used\\n\\n2.   Give the individuals the choice of weather their information can be disclosed to third party\\n\\n3.   Ensure that if it transfers personal information  to a third party ,the third party also provides the same level of privacy protection\\n\\n4.   Allow individuals access to their personal information\\n\\n5.   Take  reasonable  security  precautions  to  protect  collected  data  from  loss  misuse  or disclosure.\\n\\n6.   Take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the data collected\\n\\n7.   Have in place an adequate enforcement mechanism.\\n\\n\\nKey Characteristics of cloud computing\\n\\nThere are several characteristics of cloud computing environment. Service offering are the most often made available to specific consumers and small businesses.Multitenancy  enables\\nsharing of resources and costs among large pool of users chief benefits of Multitenancy include\\n\\n\\n\\nCentralization of Infrastructure and lower costs\\n\\nIncreased peak-load capacity\\n\\nEfficiency improvements for systems that are often underutilized\\n\\nDynamic allocation of CPU\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Characterstics include: Relaibility,Scalability,Disaster Recovery\\n\\n\\n\\nChallenges for the Cloud\\n\\nThe biggest challenge this company face are secure data storage,high-Speed Access to the internet,and standardization\\n\\n\\nSecurity and Privacy\\n\\nSecurity and Privacy of information is the biggest challenge to cloud computing. Security and privacy issues can be overcome by employing encryption, security hardware and security applications.\\n\\n\\nPortability\\n\\nThis is another challenge to cloud computing that applications should easily be migrated from one cloud provider to another. There must not be vendor lock-in. However, it is not yet made possible because each of the cloud provider uses different standard languages for their platforms.\\n\\n\\nInteroperability\\n\\nIt means the application on one platform should be able to incorporate services from the other platforms.  It  is  made possible via web  services,  but  developing such  web  services  is  very complex.\\n\\n\\nComputing Performance\\n\\nData intensive applications on cloud requires high network bandwidth, which results in high cost. Low bandwidth does not meet the desired computing performance of cloud application.\\n\\n\\nReliability and Availability\\n\\nIt is necessary for cloud systems to be reliable and robust because most of the businesses are now becoming dependent on services provided by third-party.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduction to Service Oriented Architecture\\n\\n\\n\\nThe  Service  Oriented  Architecture  is  an  architectural  design  which  includes  collection  of services in a network which communicate with each other. The complication of each service is not noticeable to other service. The service is a kind of operation which is well defined, self contained  that  provides  separate  functionality  such  as  checking  customer  account  details, printing bank statements etc and does not depend on the sate of other services.\\n\\nWhy to use SOA?\\n\\nSOA is widely used in market which responds quickly and makes effective changes according to market situations.\\n\\n\\nThe SOA keep secret the implementation details of the subsystems.\\n\\nIt allows interaction of new channels with customers, partners and suppliers.\\n\\nIt authorizes the companies to select software or hardware of their choice as it acts as platform independence.\\n\\n\\nThere are two major roles within Service-oriented Architecture:\\n\\nService provider: The service provider is the maintainer of the service and the organization that makes available one or more services for others to use. To advertise services, the provider can publish them in a registry, together with a service contract that specifies the nature of the service, how to use it, the requirements for the service, and the fees charged.\\n\\n\\nService consumer: The service consumer can locate the service metadata in the registry and develop the required client components to bind and use the service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarities between Cloud Computing and SOA:\\n\\nReuse  The idea of reuse is inherent both in Cloud Computing and SOA.\\n\\nAs needed basis  In Cloud Computing, the services are provided to the users on-demand and as needed. SOA is similar to this since the system-to-system services are on-demand and as needed as well.\\nNetwork Dependency  Cloud Computing and SOA both require an available and reliable network. If a network does not exist then the cloud services provided over the Internet would not be possible. Similarly, if a network does not exist then the communications between systems would not be possible. Thus, both Cloud Computing and SOA are dependent on a network.\\n\\n\\nCloud Contracts  In Cloud Computing, contracts entail the mutual agreement between an organization and cloud service providers. In cloud contracts, there is a cloud service provider and a cloud service consumer (the organization). In the case of SOA, contracts are important and can be either external (e.g., Yahoo! Pipes) and/or internal (e.g., organizational system integration). In SOA contracts, there are service producer(s) and service consumer(s) that are conceptually similar to cloud contracts.\\nDifferences between Cloud Computing and SOA:\\n\\nDespite the similarities between Cloud Computing and SOA, they are not the same. Following are some of the differences between them:\\nOutcome vs. Technology  In Cloud Computing, we are paying for the outcome but in SOA we are paying for technology.\\nExternal vs. External and/or Internal Point-of-View  In Cloud Computing, the services that organizations get are from external organization but in SOA these services can be either from external organizations (e.g., Yahoo! Pipes) and/or internally (e.g., system-to-system integration between two or more systems).\\nIaaS, PaaS, SaaS vs. Software Components  In Cloud Computing, the services provided can go up and down the stack but in SOA the services are software components.\\n\\n\\nVirtualization\\n\\nVirtualization is the \"creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network resources\".\\n\\n\\nIn other words, Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers and organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to  a physical storage and providing a pointer to that physical  resource when\\ndemanded.\\n\\nConcept behind the Virtualization.\\n\\nCreation  of  a  virtual  machine  over  existing  operating  system  and  hardware  is  known  as Hardware Virtualization. A Virtual machine provides an environment that is logically separated from the underlying hardware.\\n\\n\\nThe machine on which the virtual machine is going to create is known as Host Machine and that virtual machine is referred as a Guest Machine\\n\\n\\nTypes of Virtualization\\n\\n1.   Hardware Virtualization.\\n\\n2.   Operating system Virtualization.\\n\\n3.   Server Virtualization.\\n\\n4.   Storage Virtualization.\\n\\n1) Hardware Virtualization:\\n\\nWhen the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is directly installed on the hardware system is known as hardware virtualization.The main job of hypervisor is to control and monitoring the processor, memory and other hardware resources.After  virtualization  of  hardware  system  we  can  install  different  operating system on it and run different applications on those OS.\\n\\nUsage:Hardware virtualization is mainly done for the server platforms, because controlling virtual machines is much easier than controlling a physical server.\\n\\n2) Operating System Virtualization:\\n\\nWhen the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is installed on the Host operating system instead of directly on the hardware system is known as operating system virtualization.\\n\\nUsage:Operating System Virtualization is mainly used for testing the applications on different platforms of OS.\\n\\n3) Server Virtualization:\\n\\nWhen the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is directly installed on the Server system is known as server virtualization.\\n\\nUsage:Server virtualization is done because a single physical server can be divided into multiple servers on the demand basis and for balancing the load.\\n\\n\\n4) Storage Virtualization:\\n\\nStorage virtualization is the process of grouping the physical storage from multiple network storage devices so that it looks like a single storage device.Storage virtualization is also implemented by using software applications.\\n\\nUsage:Storage virtualization is mainly done for back-up and recovery purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\nA hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'CC UNIT 1 doc.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '26db4f5a75c672c04b730849525a64e9'}>]\n"
